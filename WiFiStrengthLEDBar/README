Overview
--------

When I came across a video called "Immaterials: Light painting WiFi" [1], I 
became obsessed with the idea of building such a display for long time 
exposure photography myself. Instead of using an Arduino Mega like in the 
video, I opted for a simpler Arduino (meaning UNO) and some parts that I 
already used for the LED-Matrix display, i.e. a shift register and a decade
counter. But I will get to that later.

So, what is it? The LED display bar is a long rod with evenly spaced LEDs
(my prototype is 2 meters long and carries 40 LEDs) that are supposed to
display the signal strength of WiFi networks in the area. The project is not
necessarily dependent on WiFi signals, you can use the LED bar for any display 
purposes you can imagine.

Files provided
--------------

The code directory contains all the code I created for the LED bar itself 
and for the WiFi module. Please refer to the individual directories for more
information.

Pre-made parts used
-------------------

Apart from the obvious, the project uses the following pre-made components:

- Arduino UNO
- Watterott RedFly WiFi Shield [2]
- my own Chainable555 board [3]
