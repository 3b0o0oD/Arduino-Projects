==============================================================================

This directory contains the several iterations of driver circuits for the LED
display I came up with in order to minimize power consumption of the LED bar.

I finally settled on the same technique used for my LED-Matrix diplay, meaning
exploiting the POV effect using a shift register to set the state of an 8-LED
segment and a decade counter with transistor switching to iterate through the
(currently 5) segments.
